# AWS-Ansible

##
In my repository, there is a skeleton for creating a simple infrastructure based on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The playbook can be executed from the main playbook.yml file, which serves as the starting point for setting up the infrastructure. This skeleton includes all the necessary components and configurations required to get started with using AWS, making it an ideal starting point for those looking to build a simple infrastructure on the platform. 

To run use main file [mainplaybook.yml](https://github.com/dkasyan/AWS-Ansible/blob/main/mainplaybook.yml)
+ To create your own vault.yml file, simply use the variables contained within the [template_vault.yml](https://github.com/dkasyan/AWS-Ansible/blob/main/template_vault.yml) . This will allow you to customize the file to meet your specific needs and requirements.

My role allows for the creation of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in three regions, and also the deployment of an EC2 instance. This is the starting point for further infrastructure creation.
